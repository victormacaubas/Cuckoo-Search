Initialize:
1. Generate n random solutions (nests) and evaluate their fitness.

Main Loop:
2. While stopping criterion is not met:
    a. For each cuckoo i:
        i. Generate a new solution (new egg) for cuckoo i using a Lévy flight based on its current solution:
            new_solution = current_solution + alpha * Levy(beta)
        ii. Randomly choose a nest j (other than cuckoo i's current nest).
        iii. Evaluate the fitness of new_solution.
        iv. If new_solution is better than the solution in nest j:
            - Replace the solution in nest j with new_solution.

    b. With probability p_a, abandon a fraction of the worst nests:
        i. For each abandoned nest:
            - Generate new solutions using random initialization.
            - Evaluate their fitness and replace the old nests.

    c. Rank all solutions and find the best.
    d. Optionally, replace a fraction of the worst solutions with new solutions generated via Lévy flights from the best solution.

3. Output the best solution found.
